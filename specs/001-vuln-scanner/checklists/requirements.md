# Specification Quality Checklist: Educational Vulnerability Scanner

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 28, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - ✅ PASS

The specification maintains focus on WHAT users need and WHY it matters:
- User stories describe behaviors and outcomes, not technical implementations
- Educational goals and security learning objectives are clear
- Language is accessible to stakeholders without technical background
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness - ✅ PASS

All requirements are clear and testable:
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all decisions have reasonable defaults documented
- Each functional requirement is specific and verifiable (e.g., "FR-008: System MUST complete typical scans of common ports within 2 minutes")
- Success criteria include specific, measurable metrics (e.g., "SC-003: Users can identify the top 3 highest-severity findings within 30 seconds")
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic, focusing on user outcomes not implementation (e.g., "SC-005: completes scans...in under 2 minutes" rather than "API response time")
- All user stories include detailed acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases section addresses key error and boundary conditions
- Scope is well-defined with clear boundaries (educational use, authorized scanning only)
- Dependencies are implicit (browser-based, scan utility, AI service) with graceful degradation specified

### Feature Readiness - ✅ PASS

The specification is ready for planning:
- Each of the 38 functional requirements maps to clear acceptance criteria in user stories
- 7 prioritized user stories (P1-P4) cover all primary and secondary flows
- Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-012) provide measurable targets aligned with educational goals
- No technical implementation details (no mention of React, Flask, Nmap, GPT-4 specifics) - these are intentionally abstracted
- The spec focuses on capabilities (port scanning, service identification, AI analysis, severity assessment) not how they're built

## Notes

**Specification is complete and ready for next phase**.

All checklist items pass. The specification successfully translates the technical feature description into a business/user-focused document that:
- Defines clear educational value (helping security beginners learn)
- Establishes measurable success criteria
- Provides comprehensive functional requirements
- Maintains ethical considerations throughout (disclaimers, authorized use only)
- Avoids prescribing technical implementation while clearly defining needed capabilities

Ready to proceed to `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
