# Feature Specification: Educational Vulnerability Scanner

**Feature Branch**: `001-vuln-scanner`  
**Created**: October 28, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Target Platform**: Desktop application (cross-platform: Linux, Windows, macOS)  
**Input**: User description: "Build a lightweight, desktop-based vulnerability scanner for security beginners. The app should use Nmap as the core scanning utility to detect open ports, services, and basic vulnerabilities. Present scan results in a clean, user-friendly desktop GUI. Integrate OpenAI GPT-4 to analyze Nmap output and explain each finding in simple terms, suggest recommended actions for remediation, provide references and study guides, and attempt to infer potential exploits based on known vulnerabilities and guide users on how to responsibly test them in a lab environment. Include a dashboard that highlights severity levels, links to external resources, and offers AI-generated insights and next steps. The app should be modular, beginner-friendly, and designed for educational use."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Network Scan (Priority: P1)

A security beginner wants to understand what services are running on their lab system. They enter a target IP address or hostname, initiate a scan, and receive a list of open ports and services in simple, understandable language.

**Why this priority**: This is the core MVP functionality - without the ability to scan and present results, the entire tool has no value. This establishes the fundamental workflow.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering a valid target IP, running a scan, and verifying that results display open ports and service names in the interface. Delivers immediate value by showing what's exposed on the target system.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on the scanner home page, **When** they enter a valid IP address and click "Scan", **Then** the system initiates a port scan and displays progress feedback
2. **Given** a scan is in progress, **When** the scan completes, **Then** the system displays a list of open ports with associated service names
3. **Given** scan results are displayed, **When** the user views the results, **Then** each port shows its number, state (open/closed/filtered), and identified service

---

### User Story 2 - AI-Powered Explanation of Findings (Priority: P2)

A beginner reviews scan results but doesn't understand what "SSH on port 22" or "HTTP on port 80" means. They click on a finding and receive an AI-generated explanation in plain English about what the service does, why it matters for security, and common risks.

**Why this priority**: This transforms raw technical data into learning material, which is the key differentiator for educational use. Without explanations, beginners are left to research everything manually.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking any scan result item and verifying that a clear, non-technical explanation appears explaining the service, its purpose, and basic security implications.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** scan results are displayed, **When** a user clicks on any finding, **Then** the system displays a beginner-friendly explanation of that service
2. **Given** an explanation is shown, **When** the user reads it, **Then** it includes: what the service does, why it's commonly used, and basic security considerations
3. **Given** an explanation contains technical terms, **When** the user encounters them, **Then** those terms are explained in simple language or linked to definitions

---

### User Story 3 - Severity Assessment and Prioritization (Priority: P2)

A user completes a scan and sees multiple findings but doesn't know which ones to focus on first. The system categorizes each finding by severity level (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info) with visual indicators, helping them prioritize their learning and remediation efforts.

**Why this priority**: Severity helps beginners understand risk prioritization - a core security concept. This prevents overwhelm and guides learning focus.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running a scan and verifying that each finding displays a severity badge/color and that findings can be filtered or sorted by severity level.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** scan results are available, **When** the results are displayed, **Then** each finding shows a clear severity indicator (Critical/High/Medium/Low/Info)
2. **Given** multiple findings exist, **When** the user views the dashboard, **Then** findings are grouped or sortable by severity level
3. **Given** a severity level is assigned, **When** the user views details, **Then** the system explains why that severity level was assigned

---

### User Story 4 - Remediation Guidance (Priority: P3)

A user identifies a vulnerability in their lab system and wants to know how to fix it. They view the detailed finding and receive step-by-step remediation suggestions appropriate for beginners, including what actions to take and how to verify the fix.

**Why this priority**: This extends learning from "what's wrong" to "how to fix it", completing the educational loop. It's lower priority because discovery and understanding come first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting any finding with security implications and verifying that actionable remediation steps are provided in beginner-friendly language.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a finding with security implications, **When** the user views full details, **Then** the system provides recommended remediation steps
2. **Given** remediation steps are shown, **When** the user reads them, **Then** steps are numbered, clear, and appropriate for beginner skill level
3. **Given** remediation is suggested, **When** applicable, **Then** the system includes how to verify that the fix worked

---

### User Story 5 - Learning Resources and References (Priority: P3)

A curious user wants to learn more about a specific vulnerability or security concept. Each finding links to relevant external resources (OWASP guides, CVE databases, documentation) curated for educational purposes.

**Why this priority**: This supports self-directed learning beyond the tool itself. It's important but not essential for the core scanning workflow.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing any finding and verifying that relevant, curated learning resources are linked and accessible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a finding is displayed, **When** the user scrolls to additional resources, **Then** relevant external links are provided (OWASP, CVE, vendor documentation)
2. **Given** external resources are linked, **When** the user clicks a link, **Then** it opens in a new tab to an appropriate educational resource
3. **Given** vulnerability-specific findings, **When** applicable CVE numbers exist, **Then** links to CVE details are provided

---

### User Story 6 - Exploit Information for Lab Testing (Priority: P4)

An advanced beginner working in a controlled lab environment wants to understand how a vulnerability could be exploited. The system provides information about known exploits with strong ethical disclaimers and guidance on responsible testing only in authorized environments.

**Why this priority**: This is advanced educational content useful for learners progressing toward penetration testing. It's lower priority because it requires mature understanding and carries ethical risks.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing findings with known exploits and verifying that exploit information appears with clear ethical warnings and lab-only guidance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a finding with known exploits, **When** the user views exploit information, **Then** a prominent ethical disclaimer appears before showing any exploit details
2. **Given** exploit information is requested, **When** displayed, **Then** it explains the exploit concept in educational terms, not as a how-to guide
3. **Given** exploit guidance is shown, **When** the user reads it, **Then** it emphasizes authorized testing only and references to responsible disclosure practices

---

### User Story 7 - Scan History and Progress Tracking (Priority: P4)

A user conducts multiple scans over time as they secure their lab systems. They can view historical scan results to track improvements, compare findings before and after remediation, and see their learning progress.

**Why this priority**: History tracking supports iterative learning and provides motivation through visible progress. It's a quality-of-life feature rather than core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running multiple scans on the same target over time and verifying that previous results remain accessible and comparable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple scans have been performed, **When** the user accesses scan history, **Then** previous scan results are listed with dates and targets
2. **Given** historical scans exist, **When** the user selects an old scan, **Then** they can view those results as they appeared originally
3. **Given** two scans of the same target, **When** comparing them, **Then** the system highlights what changed (new/closed ports, resolved issues)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user enters an invalid IP address or unreachable target?
- How does the system handle scan timeouts or network errors during scanning?
- What if AI analysis fails or is temporarily unavailable - can users still see raw scan results?
- How does the system prevent users from accidentally scanning unauthorized targets (e.g., external IPs)?
- What happens when scanning a target with hundreds of open ports - how are results paginated or limited?
- How does the system handle different network permissions (user may not have rights to perform certain scans)?
- What if a scan is interrupted mid-process - can it be resumed or must it restart?
- How are findings handled when a service version cannot be determined?
- What happens if multiple scans are initiated simultaneously?
