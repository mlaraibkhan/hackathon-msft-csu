# Tasks: Educational Vulnerability Scanner

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-vuln-scanner/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Based on plan.md structure:
- Backend: `backend/src/`, `backend/tests/`
- Frontend: `frontend/src/`, `frontend/tests/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí P4)
- **Real-Time Progress (Phase 10)**: Enhancement to US1, can be done anytime after US1
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ **MVP STARTS HERE**
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Extends US1 findings with AI analysis
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Extends US1 findings with severity
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Depends on US2 (uses AI analysis) - Adds remediation to explanations
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Depends on US2 (uses AI analysis) - Adds resources to explanations
- **User Story 6 (P4)**: Depends on US2 and US3 (uses AI + severity) - Advanced educational content
- **User Story 7 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent history feature

### Within Each User Story

- Backend models/services before API endpoints
- API endpoints before frontend components
- Frontend components before page integration
- Core implementation before enhancements
- Story complete and tested before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T002-T008 can all run in parallel (8 tasks)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 
- T011-T014 (models) in parallel (4 tasks)
- T016-T023 (infrastructure) in parallel (8 tasks)

**Phase 3 (User Story 1)**:

- T031-T033 (backend setup) in parallel (3 tasks)
- T042-T045 (frontend components) in parallel (4 tasks)

**Phase 4 (User Story 2)**:
- T042-T043 (AI setup) in parallel (2 tasks)
- T049-T050 (frontend components) in parallel (2 tasks)

**Phase 5 (User Story 3)**:
- T055, T059-T061 (utilities and components) in parallel (4 tasks)

**All Phases**: Tasks marked [P] within each story can be parallelized

**Cross-Story Parallelization**: Once Foundational completes, multiple developers can work on different user stories simultaneously:
- Developer A: User Story 1 (MVP)
- Developer B: User Story 2 (AI explanations)
- Developer C: User Story 3 (Severity)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# After Foundational phase completes, launch US1 tasks in parallel:

# Backend tasks (parallel):
Task T031: "Install python-nmap in backend/requirements.txt"
Task T032: "Create ScanService in backend/src/services/scan_service.py"
Task T033: "Create TargetService in backend/src/services/target_service.py"

# Frontend tasks (parallel):
Task T042: "Create ScanForm component in frontend/src/components/ScanForm.tsx"
Task T043: "Create ScanProgress component in frontend/src/components/ScanProgress.tsx"
Task T044: "Create ScanResults component in frontend/src/components/ScanResults.tsx"
Task T045: "Create FindingRow component in frontend/src/components/FindingRow.tsx"

# Then sequential integration tasks (depend on above):
Task T034: "Implement target validation" (needs T033)
Task T038-T041: "API endpoints and scan execution" (needs T032)
Task T046-T051: "Page integration and error handling" (needs T042-T045)
```

**Parallel Opportunities**: 85+ tasks marked [P] can run in parallel with others in their phase

**MVP Scope** (Phase 1-3): 54 tasks to deliver basic scanning functionality with privilege handling

**Suggested First Milestone**: Complete through Phase 5 (User Stories 1-3) = 79 tasks for core educational scanner

**Cross-Platform Testing**: 15 tasks dedicated to ensuring compatibility across Linux, Windows, and macOS

**Performance Validation**: 5 tasks (T149-T152, plus T146-T148) dedicated to verifying success criteria SC-002, SC-008, SC-013-SC-019

**Security & Privileges**: 8 tasks specifically for handling elevated privileges required by nmap

---

## Notes

- Each task includes exact file path for implementation
- [P] marker indicates parallelization opportunity (different files, no dependencies)
- [Story] label (US1-US7) maps tasks to user stories from spec.md
- Each user story delivers independently testable functionality
- Tests are NOT included (not requested in specification)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Foundational phase MUST complete before any user story work begins
- Commit after each task or logical group for easy rollback
- **CRITICAL**: Desktop application architecture using Electron + Python backend with IPC communication
- **CRITICAL**: Network scanning requires elevated privileges - handled by privilege helper module
- Cross-platform compatibility validated through platform-specific E2E tests and packaging verification
